Script does not seem to be compressed, no pointers required, game generates the pointers at boot

Script Format (seems to be the same as the main game):
00-EF = Basic Table
F0 = Space
F1 = ?

Special Bytes (Amount of bytes):
F2 (1) = ?
F3 (1) = New Line?
F4 (1) = New Line?
F5 (2) = Sound?
F6 (1) = Scroll, New Line
F7 (1) = New Line?
F8 (1) = New Line?
F9 (1) = New Line?
FA (1) = End Section (Event After)
FB (1) = End Section
FC (2) = Kanji?
FD (2) = Kanji?
FE (1+) =
	68 (1) = 2 Choices
	69 (1) = Wait until user press button?
	6A (1) = ?
	6B (1) = ?
	6C (1) = ?
	6D (2) = Image?
	6E (1) = 3 Choices
	6F (1) = ?
	70 (1) = ?
	71 (1) = ?
	72 (1) = ?
FF (1) = End of Script Data

 max 24 char per line by default

Kanji Ordering is the same between all parts. It's however different between Time Athletic, Camp Arnold and the main game.
